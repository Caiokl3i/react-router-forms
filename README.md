# React Router Form Project

This repository contains my first project using **React Router** and **forms**, developed independently to practice and demonstrate what I’ve learned about React routing and state management between pages.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The project allows users to:
- Fill out a form with personal information (name, age, email, etc.)
- Navigate between pages using **React Router**
- Pass and display form data across different routes

It was built as part of my learning journey in **React** to strengthen my understanding of:
- Routing with `react-router-dom`
- Handling form inputs and state
- Component structure and data flow in React

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **React**
- **React Router DOM**
- **CSS Modules**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
